	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.glade: remove width_request from

	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.1.in: add manpage section

2008-03-22  Colin Walters  <walters@verbum.org>

	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.c: Grab a name on the
	session bus to be doubly sure we don't have
	multiple copies.  Also don't connect to the
	session manager, since it's not needed.

	make things slightly more readable.

	* configure.ac: Release 0.7

2006-07-24  Christopher Aillon  <caillon@redhat.com>

	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.c: Don't immediately retry
	to reach the KDC if it is unavailable. That will
	just loop forever (until the KDC becomes available).
	Bail out; we'll check (once!) to see whether it's
	there the next time our g_timeout callback gets
	invoked.

2006-04-18  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* configure.ac: Remove obsolete entry for no_NO

2006-03-17  Christopher Aillon  <caillon@redhat.com>

2006-02-01  Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.c: keep track of whether or not the user
	explicitly canceled our last request for information.  If she did,
	then don't ask again while the expiration time remains unchanged.
	Change recursion inside of renew_credentials() into a loop in its
	calling function.

2006-02-01  Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.c(krb5_gtk_prompter): rename to avoid polluting
	the krb5 namespace.
	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.c: don't use time() to figure out what time it
	is -- we always compare against a krb5_timestamp, so use the libkrb5
	routines which return the current time instead.

2006-02-01  Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
	* README: correct a typo
	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.c(renew_credentials): fix a warning where we

	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.1.in: add a man page.

2005-11-02  Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>

	* configure.ac,src/krb5-auth-dialog.c: make the minimum acceptable
	lifetime for new credentials the minimum that would force us to take
	action, not the amount of time we wait in between checks.  Let the
	check interval be defined in seconds and the minimum lifetime be
	specified in minutes.

2005-11-02  Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>

	* configure.ac,src/krb5-auth-dialog.c: just test for the definitions
	of the flags directly.

	* Makefile.am:
	* krb5-auth-dialog.spec.in:
	* src/krb5-auth-dialog.c
	Patch from Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
	- Fix the .spec file so that it doesn't choke due to
	translations.
	- Include the .spec file in the dist tarball so that
	'rpmbuild -ts' will work.
	- Correct a compiler warning.
	- Set forwardable/proxiable/lifetime from the current ccache,
	if there is one.
	- Add a "--always" flag to let us pinch-hit for 'kinit'.
	- Add a "--auto" flag to override it.
	- Interpret a preauthentication failure as a bad password.
	- If we already have a ccache, use its default principal as our 
	default, in case it differs from the local user name.  If the 
	default principal changes out from under us, pick it up, too.
	- Don't give a bogus lifetime if the ccache is deleted between 
	checks.
