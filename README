krb5-auth-dialog is a simple dialog that monitors kerberos tickets, and
pops up a dialog when they are about to expire.  Eventually, we expect
it to be part of GNOME.

Configuration:
Configuration settings are handled via gconf.

You can set the principal that is used to acquire tickets via:
gconftool-2 --type=string --set /apps/krb5-auth-dialog/principal "principal@YOUR.REALM"

You can hide the tray icon via:
gconftool-2 --type=bool --set /apps/krb5-auth-dialog/show_trayicon false

You can set the time of the first password prompt via:
gconftool-2 --type=int --set /apps/krb5-auth-dialog/prompt_minutes 30

You can set the principals pkinit identifier via:
gconftool-2 --type=string --set /apps/krb5-auth-dialog/pk_userid "FILE:/path/to/user.pem,/path/to/user.key"
or if you're using a smartcard:
gconftool-2 --type=string --set /apps/krb5-auth-dialog/pk_userid "PKCS11:/usr/lib/opensc/opensc-pkcs11.so"

A note on translations:
Kerberos doesn't translate either its prompts or its error messages.
As the prompt is very visible, we need to translate it externally.  To
do this, the etpo binary in etpo/ can be used to extract the public
strings that kerberos uses.  We are checking that in for now, until
kerberos gets translated.
