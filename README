krb5-auth-dialog is a simple dialog that monitors kerberos tickets, and
pops up a dialog when they are about to expire.  Eventually, we expect
it to be part of GNOME.

A note on translations:

Kerberos doesn't translate either it's prompts or its error messages.
As the prompt is very visible, we need to translate it externally.  To
do this, the etpo binary in etpo/ can be used to extract the public
strings that kerberos uses.  We are checking that in for now, until
kerberos gets translated.
