.SH NAME
krb5-auth-dialog \- Kerberos 5 credential checking

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B krb5-auth-dialog [--auto]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBkrb5-auth-dialog\fR application will periodically check (every
@check_interval@ seconds) if the user has Kerberos credentials, and if so, if
they will expire soon (in less than @minimum_lifetime@ minutes).  If it
determines that this is the case, \fBkrb5-auth-dialog\fR will attempt to obtain fresh
credentials, prompting the user for whatever information is necessary.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
\fB--auto\fR
If this option is specified, \fBkrb5-auth-dialog\fR will start only if it
finds that the user has Kerberos credentials. This may be used to
ensure that only users who actually use Kerberos see the program.
Note that in some settings, users may authenticate to Kerberos at a
later time even if they do not have Kerberos credentials initially.

Probably, but let's hope not.  If you find any, please file them in the
