.SH NAME
krb5-auth-dialog \- Kerberos 5 credential checking

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B krb5-auth-dialog [--auto]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The krb5-auth-dialog application will periodically check (every
@check_interval@ seconds) if the user has Kerberos credentials, and if so, if
they will expire soon (in less than @minimum_lifetime@ minutes).  If it
determines that this is the case, krb5-auth-dialog will attempt to obtain fresh
credentials, prompting the user for whatever information is necessary.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
\fB--auto\fR
If this option is specified, \fBkrb5-auth-dialog\fR will exit if it finds that the
user has no Kerberos credentials.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR krb5.conf (5)

.SH BUGS
Probably, but let's hope not.  If you find any, please file them in the
bug database at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/ against the
"krb5-auth-dialog" component.
