.SH NAME
krb5-auth-dialog \- Kerberos 5 credential checking

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B krb5-auth-dialog [--always|--auto]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The krb5-auth-dialog application will periodically check (every
@check_interval@ seconds) if the user has Kerberos credentials, and if so, if
they will expire soon (in less than @minimum_lifetime@ minutes).  If it
determines that this is the case, krb5-auth-dialog will attempt to obtain fresh
credentials, prompting the user for whatever information is necessary.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.IP --always
By default, krb5-auth-dialog will exit if it finds that the user has no
Kerberos credentials.  If this option is specified, then it will instead
attempt to get credentials.

.IP --auto
Overrides the --always option, restoring the default behavior.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR krb5.conf (5)

.SH BUGS
Probably, but let's hope not.  If you find any, please file them in the
bug database at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/ against the
"krb5-auth-dialog" component.
